                <p>The Gokarnanatheshwara Temple, otherwise known as Kudroli Sri Gokarnanatha Kshetra, is in the Kudroli area of Mangalore in Karnataka, India. It was consecrated by Narayana Guru. It is dedicated to Gokarnanatha, a form of Lord Shiva. This temple was built in 1912 by Adhyaksha HoigeBazar Koragappa.

                    <h4>History</h4>
                    <p>The Billavas are Aboriginals/ Natives of the Western Ghats and the Western Coast of Karnataka. The first known empire of the Billvas was the Chera empire somewhere around 200 BCE. <br><br>
                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Narayana_Guru.jpg" alt="Narayana_Guru" class="namrayanaimg">

                        The Chera Kings of the Chera dynasty(200 BCE - 1100 CE) had the title of Villavar(Billava). It is known that several Villavar/ Billava clans came together to form an early Chera Empire along the Western coast and Western Ghats in South India. The early Cheras were around the region of Muziris. Muziris was identified as the region around Mangalore in Southwestern Karnataka.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] The Chera Kingdom had an emblem of the Bow and Arrow (Billu/ Villu and Bana) on their flags. The silver punch marked coins of the Chera empire with the symbol of bow(Billu) have been discovered relating to the term Billavas. They then started moving towards and conquering parts of now Tamil Nadu, hence we see the confluence of many Tamil words in Titles and common addresses.Later with the advent of other sects like Nagas (example being shettys who consider themselves naga Kshatriyas) and Jains in the region, influenced the Chera kingdoms cultural practises such as Naga worship and building of Jain monasteries. With the rise of other empires like the Pandyas and Cholas, the Chera empire slowly came to an end starting from 5th century CE. <br><br>
                        
                        There is brief mention of the Chera empire by Kautilya(Chanakya)(3-4 century BCE), Katyayana (3-4 century BCE), Patanjali (5 century BCE) among others. <br><br>
                        
                        The other most recent,famous and prosperous empire is the Tuluva Dynasty (1491 - 1570 AD) of the Vijayanagar empire. Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagar empire was Tulu speaking and Tulu is spoken only along coastal karnataka namely Mangalore (Dakshina Karnataka) and Udupi.Since billavas were the aboriginals/ natives speaking Tulu this dynasty and its warlords were definitely a part of them. <br><br>
                        
                        The Billava community [10][11] wanted to carve a niche for themselves in the realm of spirituality. They wanted to be able to personalise the spiritual offering to their deity Lord Shiva with norms in accordance to the billava tradition. It is in such a scenario that Adhyaksha Koragappa a billava leader and businessman took the initiative and sought a Guru for this spiritual quest. <br><br>

                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Adhyaksha_Koragappa%2C_the_builder_of_the_Gokarnath_Temple._A_great_devotee_of_Shri_Narayana_Guru_and_Bhagawan_Nityananda_of_Ganeshpuri.jpg/330px-Adhyaksha_Koragappa%2C_the_builder_of_the_Gokarnath_Temple._A_great_devotee_of_Shri_Narayana_Guru_and_Bhagawan_Nityananda_of_Ganeshpuri.jpg" alt="Adhyaksha photo">
                        Adhyaksha Koragappa led a delegation of Billava elders and visited Shri Narayana Guru in 1908. He invited Shri Narayana Guru to guide the billavas to build a temple. <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Adhyaksha Koragappa, the Founder of the Gokarnanatheshwara Temple, Kudroli. A great devotee of Shri Narayana Guru and Bhagawan Nityananda of Ganeshpuri <br><br>
                        The community found a messiah in Narayana Guru to guide them in this spiritual quest. Narayana Guru with his knowledge and experience in spirituality became the ideal guide and guru (from the south of India closest to Mangalore) for the billavas to help them build a temple of their deity, Lord Shiva. <br><br>
                        
                        Adhyaksha Koragappa was a very well known businessman in Mangalore who had a large tile factory. He also conducted extensive trade in the 1900s with business enterprises in Middle East, Africa, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, trading mainly in Mangalore tiles, copra, spices and other natural products. <br><br>
                        
                        On the arrival of Shri Narayana Guru in Mangalore, Adhyaksha Koragappa gave him a horse-driven carriage to select a suitable place for a temple. Narayana Guru between places Mulihithilu (where a lot of linga Roopa Aradhana used to happen especially from saints of NATH tradition) and Kudroli, selected Kudroli. <br><br>
                        
                        Koragappa family still maintains the CHAIR on which Shri Narayana Guru sat in Adhyaksha Koragappa's house and addressed Adhyaksha Koragappa and others regarding various issues including the creation of a temple. <br><br>
                        
                        Adhyaksha Koragappa then gave the necessary land and funds to build this temple in 1912 seeking blessings and spiritual guidance of Shri Narayana Guru. The Shiva linga was brought by Shri Narayana Guru himself.</p>
